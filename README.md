## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Vue 3 (Composition API) for interactivity
- JavaScript for email validation and state management

### What I Learned

This project deepened my understanding of Vue 3's Composition API. I also gained more experience implementing form validation and handling dynamic states like toggling between the form and success message views.

### Continued Development

I aim to enhance my skills in creating reusable Vue components and improving accessibility in form elements. Future projects will focus on more interactive components and state management with Pinia.
